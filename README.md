# Postgres-Project

## Overview

This project was done in PostgreSQL

The dataset could be located in the "YOUTH UNEMPLOYMENT" folder labeled as "youth_unemployment_global.csv".
This dataset was downloaded from Kaggle.

To use or try code, change directory of data import to directory on your pc.




The goal of this analysis is to identify the countries with the highest and countries with the lowest 
unemployment rate, the specific years within which these rates were recorded, what
the possible causes of these hikes or drops maybe, how long they lasted and why they lasted that long.


A total of 266 locations were captured in this data.
On average each location had about 32 to 33 years of data available in the dataset.
Observations span mainly from 1991 - 2024. 


	The median youth unemployment rate: 14.182%

	maximum unemployment rate: 82.4090%
	
	minimum unemployment rate: 0.2950%
	
	Average unemployment rate: 16.6677%
	

From the analysis it was discovered that Djibouti was the country to have recorded
the highest youth unemployment rate throughout the entire 34 year period which was
recorded in 2020. 
Qatar was the country to experience the lowest unemployment rate ever recorded
at rate of 0.295%. This occured in 2019.

Between the years 2019 and 2020 about 71 countries had their youth unemployment rate
between 13 % and 19 %. However by 2021 about 16 countries had dropped from this range.
This could probably be as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2019-2020.
The aftermath of this pandemic was quite overwhelming for some countries due to the
mortality rate and trade and travel restriction at the time.
The highest unemployment rate recorded in 2019 was 75.9180% and once again it was Djibouti.

Myanmar experienced the highest percentage change in unemployment rate between 2019 and 2020
with its rate being hit by a 277.38% increase within the one year period.
